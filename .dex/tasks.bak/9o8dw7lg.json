Structure: docs/<route>/##-<name>.svelte where ## is the display order index and <name> becomes the section title. For example, docs/elements/01-Carousel.svelte would appear first on /elements route with title 'Carousel'. The route page would dynamically load all demos from its corresponding docs folder, ordered by the numeric prefix, eliminating manual imports and CodeExample registration.\n\nBeads metadata:\n- beads_id: graffiti-q7l\n- beads_status: open\n- beads_type: feature\n- beads_priority: 2\n- labels: none\n- assignee: none\n- notes: none\n- created_at: 2025-12-24T11:05:39.062002-07:00\n- updated_at: 2025-12-24T11:05:39.062002-07:00\n- closed_at: none\n- dependencies: none",
