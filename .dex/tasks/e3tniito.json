  "context": "Beads description:\nCreate a reusable Svelte 5 component for documentation code examples using svelte-highlight (https://github.com/metonym/svelte-highlight).\n\nSimilar to https://base-ui.com/react/components/accordion but simpler - since Graffiti is CSS-only, no props table or API reference needed. Just:\n1. Live preview in a resizable container\n2. Syntax-highlighted source code\n\nRequirements:\n- Accept a demo component as a prop\n- Import the demo as both:\n  1. A rendered component (to display in a resizable preview box)\n  2. A raw string (for syntax highlighting with svelte-highlight)\n- Resizable preview container so users can test responsive behavior\n- Syntax highlighted code block showing the source\n- Should work with Graffiti's light/dark theming\n- Svelte 5 patterns only (runes, snippets, etc.)\n- Clean, minimal UI - let the examples speak for themselves\n\nReference: https://github.com/metonym/svelte-highlight\n\nBeads metadata:\n- beads_id: graffiti-djc\n- beads_status: closed\n- beads_type: feature\n- beads_priority: 1\n- labels: none\n- assignee: none\n- notes: none\n- created_at: 2025-12-15T12:17:17.759439-07:00\n- updated_at: 2025-12-15T13:58:11.25974-07:00\n- closed_at: 2025-12-15T13:58:11.25974-07:00\n- dependencies: none",
